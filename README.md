## Topic Modelling using LDA

This project implements a **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** pipeline to discover hidden topics from a text corpus.  
It is modular, pip-installable, and supports interactive visualizations using **pyLDAvis**.

## Topic Modelling Overview

**Topic Modelling** is an unsupervised learning technique used to extract topics from a large corpus of text automatically.  
Topics can be defined as the co-occurring terms that frequently repeat in the text corpus.

Topic modeling is helpful in various tasks such as:
- Clustering documents
- Understanding and summarizing an extensive collection of textual documents
- Retrieving information from large text datasets

In this project, topic modelling is performed using:
- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**
- We use a **Medium articles dataset** consisting of 350 articles related to AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science.


## Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

LDA is an **unsupervised probabilistic statistical model** that automatically discovers topics present in a collection of documents.

### Key Assumptions:
- A document is a mixture of multiple topics.
- Each topic is a probability distribution over words.
- Words in documents are generated by first choosing a topic, then picking a word from that topic's distribution.

## How to run:

Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run full pipeline: python main.py
Output: After running the pipeline, you’ll get:
- outputs/models/lda_model.pkl → Saved LDA model
- outputs/visualizations/lda_vis.html - Interactive topic visualization
- outputs/topics/topic_keywords.csv → CSV of top words per topic
- Bar plots of keywords per topic
